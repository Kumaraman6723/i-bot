# Note:- :rocket:

Since heroku uses:- Dyno sleeping in which if an app has a free web dyno, and that dyno receives no web traffic in a 30-minute period, it will sleep. In addition to the web dyno sleeping, the worker dyno (if present) will also sleep. and if a sleeping web dyno receives web traffic, it will become active again after a short delay (assuming your account has free dyno hours available)
You can use (http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com) to ping the heroku app every 30 minutes to prevent it from sleeping.
